# Mandarin
Random cumulation of notes while learning mandarin

怎么样 is used to ask "how something is". Literally 怎么 = how/why and 样 = kind, type, way, manner. So I think "How about it/this" is a pretty good way to think of it. It can also be used to ask someone's opinion about something by putting it after a statement: 去喝咖啡怎么样？"How about going for coffee?" or literally "go drink coffee, how about it?"
